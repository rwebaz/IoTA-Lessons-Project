## IOTA DIWK

The Internet of Things Class A, or [IoTA](https://){:title='Internet of Things Class A'}{:target='_blank'} Foundation located in Berlin, Germany EU is a pioneer in Distributed Ledger Technology, or [DLT](https://){:title='Distributed Ledger Technology'}{:target='_blank'}.

What does the acronym `DIWK` represent?

- **Data**, the plural of a set of datum(s) ...

- **Info**, the array of many inputs of data ...

- **Wisdom**, the ability to discern what is real and what is noise emanating from the information ...

- **Knowledge**, the end result of a correct read of the reality of our universe produced by our wisdom

### Trinary Alphabet

```liquid
{% raw %}
// Declare the entire Trinary ( Balanced Ternary ) Alphabet in Go as a variable
var tryteAlpha string;
// Assign the value of the entire Trinary Alphabet in `tryte` to the variable `tryteAlpha`
tryteAlpha = "9ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
{% endraw %}
```

Using the `:=` operator in Go as a shortcut method ...

```liquid
{% raw %}
// Declare and simultaneously assign the entire Trinary Alphabet to the variable `tryteAlpha`
tryteAlpha := "9ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
{% endraw %}
```

**Note**. The **GO** compiler will infer `string` as the type of variable declared based on the assigned value.

## Trits n Trytes

In the land of **IOTA**, we use base numbers of the **Trinary** ( Balanced Ternary ) computer language called *Trits* and *Trytes*.

A `trit` is the base digit within the **Trinary** computer language from which all *Trytes* are assembled.

A `tryte` possesses three (3) `trit`.

Hence, the **TRI**-nary computer language based on triple `trit` and their product the `tryte`.

## Layers O Security

Three levels of security exist when expressing an *address* in the **Trinary** computer language.

If you choose the default level of security, you have selected the highest level, namely **Level 3**.

At **Level 3** security within the **Trinary** computer language an *address* consumes a space filled with two-hundred and forty-three (243) `trit`.

Each `tryte` being of three (3) `trit`, one can easily decipher the number of `tryte` within an *address* of two-hundred and forty-three (243) `trit` by simply dividing by three (3).

Here, we have produced the product of eighty-one (81) by dividing the dividend of two-hundred and forty-three (243) `trit` by the divisor of three (3) to obtain the result in `tryte`.

But, what are `tryte`, you may ask?

Well, in the world of the **Trinary** computer language, a `tryte` represents a member of the **Trinary** computer language alphabet.

From which you may build an *address*.

## Your Address

So, we need an *address* of eighty-one (81) `tryte` picked at random.

In the **Trinary** computer language, the numeral nine (9) represents the decimal concept of zero.

So, when you see a nine (9), think zero (0).

Other than this strange quirk, the balance of the alphabet for the **Trinary** computer language is fairly straight forward ... for the *Latin-based* human language reading world, as follows:

## A Cell Centered Table In Kramdown - Markdown

```liquid
{% raw %}
|-----------+-----------+-----------|
|tryte|trit|decimal|
|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
|9|[0,0,0]|0||
{% endraw %}
```

### Live Rendition

|-----------+-----------+-----------|
|tryte|trit|decimal|
|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
|9|[0,0,0]|0|
|A|[0,0,1]|1|
|B|[0,1,-1]|2|
|C|[0,1,0]|3|
|D|[0,1,1]|4|
|E|[1,-1,-1]|5|
|F|[1,-1,0]|6|
|G|[1,-1,1]|7|
|H|[1,0,-1]|8|
|I|[1,0,0]|9|
|J|[1,0,1]|10|
|K|[1,1,-1]|11|
|L|[1,1,0]|12|
|M|[1,1,1]|13|
|N|[-1,-1,-1]|-13|
|O|[-1,-1,0]|-12|
|P|[-1,-1,1]|-11|
|Q|[-1,0,-1]|-10|
|R|[-1,0,0]|-9|
|S|[-1,0,1]|-8|
|T|[-1,1,-1]|-7|
|U|[-1,1,0]|-6|
|V|[-1,1,1]|-5|
|W|[0,-1,-1]|-4|
|X|[0,-1,0]|-3|
|Y|[0,1,-1]|-2|
|Z|[0,0,-1]|-1|

**Note**. Notice how the flow of *Latin-based* uppercase (capital) letters from **A**-to-**Z** remains uninterrupted when scanning the table vertically ... after hurdling the initial concept of zero.

However, not so on the *decimal* side (the right column) of the table.

Notice how the flow of decimals stops when scanning the table vertically at the junction of the *decimals* thirteen (13) and the numeral *negative thirteen*, or (-13).

The flow then restarts in negative reverse from *negative thirteen*, or (-13) through and inclusive of *negative one*, or (-1) at the end of the table.

Spooky, huh!

I'll bet you'll never look at the eight (8) ball again the same way when playing pool ... it's now an "H" in `tryte`!

Similarly, notice how the *decimal* numeral nine (9) is now an "I" in `tryte` ...

Even though the `tryte` letter nine (9) represents the *decimal* numeral zero (0).

Confusing?

### Center O Trits

Smack in the center of the table is a collection of ones and zeros similar to the **Binary** computer language.

Here, however, in the **Trinary** computer language ...

We use a combination set of three ( ones and zeros ) instead of the normal combination set of two ( ones and zeros ) as in the now familiar **BI**-nary computer language.

Plus, in the **Trinary** computer language ...

We use *negative* ( ones and zeros ) in the formation of the corresponding combination set of three `trit` ...

As well as *positive* ( ones and zeros ) as is the case in the **Binary** computer language.

### Por ejemplo

For example, the `tryte` "Z" is represented by a combination set of three `trit` ...

Namely, "zero, zero, and minus-one", or [0,0,-1] ...

Plus, the `tryte` "Z" also represents the decimal numeral *negative-one* or (-1) ... 

*Simultaneously*.

The key being, of course ... the shared `trit` combination set of [0,0,-1].

### Computing Eyes

So, when the computer sees the `trit` combination set of [0,0,-1] when compiling for the **Trinary** computer language ...

It *thinks* the decimal numeral *negative-one* or (-1).

Conversely, when the computer sees the `tryte` "Z" ...

It *thinks* the `trit` combination set of [0,0,-1].

Hence, the astronomical impossibility of cracking an *address* formed out of a set of eighty-one (81) `tryte`.

### Evil Quanta

So, you are a *nefarious one*, heh?

And, you wish to crack your neighbor's **IOTA** address, steal his or her coins, and purchase an island in the South Pacific.

Away from the toils and troubles of Hollywood gossip.

How do you do it?

In short, you would need a quantum computer chock full of entangled *qubits* suspended in superposition ...

To even attempt to crack an **IOTA** *address* over at the **Deep Data Pool** network, or **DDP** before the death of our universe as we now know it.

But, that ain't gonna happen until way after the year #2050.

In the interim, enjoy the **IOTA** **DDP** ...!

One day you may just be funding a foray into its deep data depths for the benefit of your corporation, and your job!
